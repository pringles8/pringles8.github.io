# Data Science Portfolio

This is the most up-to-date location for personal and school projects that I want to display. I do have projects that I do not display (either because they are incomplete, in progress, or for my personal use). I hope it gives a good sense of what I can do and where my skills are at. I aim for them to be concise snips of presentations - quick and easy-to-digest. If you have any criticism, feel free to message me on LinkedIn, which is linked on the sidebar, or my email, which is on my resume at the very bottom.

## Wordle Game AI
This project was done as part of my foundations of artificial intelligence class. Our motivation came from one of my teammates being a New York Times reader who saw their acquisition of the Wordle game and the surge in automated solvers. There are plenty of methods applied to the game with repos online. My team used existing methods as well as some which we wrote up from our class textbook - 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach' by Russel & Norvig.

For this project, my team built out the game, a simple UI, and four solvers/solving agents. The whole project was done in python and the repository is linked below. I focused on two types of solvers that I found interesting - a genetic algorithm based solver and a Q-learning agent.

To begin, I will explain what Wordle is. Wordle is a word guessing game. The most common variant has a word-of-the-day. This word is usually five letters long. The game allows six guesses. After each guess, the letters are shaded by the game to give the player information. A green letter means that the letter is correct and in the right position. A yellow letter means the word contains that letter but it is not positioned correctly. Lastly, an uncolored letter is not in the word.

## Computer Vision Micro-Projects
These are a series of smaller projects done as part of my computer vision class. I will give a brief description of each and link my repo for them at the end.

### Motion Detection Using Simple Image Filtering

### Image Mosaicking

### Stereo Vision Dense Disparity Mapping

## Air Quality Analysis

## Mars Rover Classification

## Audio Source Separation

*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
